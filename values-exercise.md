# Identify 10-15 values that are most important to you.

# Now try to identify 3-4 values that are most important to you at this point in time. There is no need to limit yourself to the words on this list. The following questions may help:
## Which values are non-negotiable?
## Which ones must I honor to feel like my best self?
## When I look at my first list, do I notice any patterns that may indicate an overarching top value? For example, choosing friendship, family, community may indicate that relationships are a top priority.

# Gut check.
Do my choices feel authentic, as opposed to representing what I think I should value, or what I used to value?
