# Exercise 1
## Identify 10-15 values that are most important to you.

1. Balance
2. Compassion
3. Empathy
4. Freedom
5. Happiness
6. Honesty
7. Independence
8. Security
9. Pleasure
10. Learning
11. Kindess
12. Humor
    
## Now try to identify 3-4 values that are most important to you at this point in time. There is no need to limit yourself to the words on this list. The following questions may help:

* Security
* Contentment (Replaced happiness, which replaced pleasure)
* Kindness
* Humor

### Which values are non-negotiable?

Security. For me this means financial security.

### Which ones must I honor to feel like my best self?

Humor

### When I look at my first list, do I notice any patterns that may indicate an overarching top value? For example, choosing friendship, family, community may indicate that relationships are a top priority.

Being kind and enjoying myself. 

## Gut check.

### Do my choices feel authentic, as opposed to representing what I think I should value, or what I used to value?

Yes

# Exercise 2

## Step 1. Review the core values you chose in the "Identify Your Core Values" activity. Reflect on the following questions:

### How do I fulfill my values in my work and my life?

### To what extent am I currently living out my values?

### Are there areas in my life where I'd like to be living out my values more? What are those areas? How can I live out my values in them? (We suggest you identify specific behaviors that feel possible for you).

## Step 2. Recreate the table below, and try filling it in using the core values you selected. Most of us have room to grow in terms of how we fulfill our core values.
| My Values       | How I fulfill my values in my work.           | How I fulfill my values in my life.  |
| ------------- |:------------| :-----|
| 1 Security | Get paid | Save money |
| 2 Humor |       |  |
| 3 Happiness |       |  |
| 4 Kindness |       |  |


## Step 3. An honest look at the table can reveal both insights and questions. If you wish to dig deeper at this point, take 15 - 30 minutes and reflect on the following:

### Are there areas in my life where I'd like to be living out my values more?
### What are those areas?
### How can I live out my values in those areas?
